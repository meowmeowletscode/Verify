Verify Android mobile application<br><br>
This is my practice project. <br><br>
It include the top menu drawer for input XLXS and XLS file, and Export data to Excel file.<br><br>
You can import your file and see it in checklist, enter the barcode number and the response record will be check/uncheck<br><br>
Feel free to add your own function, good luck.<br>
